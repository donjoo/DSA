# 1. üö¶ What is a Queue?

# A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

#     Think of a queue at a ticket counter: the person who gets in first is served first.

# 2. üß± Types of Queues
# 1. Simple Queue

#     Basic FIFO queue.

#     Insertion from rear, deletion from front.

# 2. Circular Queue

#     The last position is connected to the first to make a circle.

#     Efficient memory usage (no "wasted" space at the front).

# 3. Priority Queue

#     Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just order.

#     Can be implemented using heaps.

# 4. Deque (Double Ended Queue)

#     Insertion and deletion from both ends.

#     Can be input restricted or output restricted.


# 5. üõ†Ô∏è Applications of Queue

#     CPU Scheduling

#     Printer Queue

#     Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#     Handling Requests (IO Buffers, Web Servers)

#     Cache (LRU)
