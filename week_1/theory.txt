ðŸ“ˆ What are Asymptotic Notations?
They describe the growth behavior of an algorithm as the input size n approaches infinity.
    In short: How fast does the time or space grow as input grows?


ðŸ”µ 2. Big O Notation (O) â€” Upper Bound
ðŸ“Œ Definition:
    Big O gives the worst-case growth rate of an algorithm.
It means:
    "The algorithm will take at most this much time/space."
ðŸ§  Use Cases:
    Analyzing worst-case performance
    Performance guarantees


ðŸŸ¢ 3. Omega Notation (Î©) â€” Lower Bound
ðŸ“Œ Definition:
    Omega gives the best-case growth rate.
It means:
    "The algorithm will take at least this much time/space."
ðŸ§  Use Cases:
    Understanding how fast the algorithm can perform in the best scenario

ðŸŸ¡ 4. Theta Notation (Î˜) â€” Tight Bound
ðŸ“Œ Definition:
    Theta defines an exact (tight) bound.
    It means the algorithm will take this much time in all cases (best, average, worst).
