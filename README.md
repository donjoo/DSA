# 📐 DSA Lab

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Lab** — a personal repository where I practice, experiment, and explore various DSA concepts and problems. From brute-force to optimized solutions, this repo is my space to break things down, build them back up, and learn along the way.

---

## 💡 What’s Inside

This repo includes:

- ✅ Implementations of classic algorithms
- 🧠 Practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
- 🧩 Patterns & techniques (sliding window, recursion, backtracking, etc.)
- 📓 Notes, explanations, and code walkthroughs

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Hashing  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Binary Trees & BSTs  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Two Pointers / Sliding Window  
- Prefix Sum / Difference Array

## 🚀 Purpose

> _“You don’t really understand an algorithm until you implement it from scratch.”_


This repo is for:
- Practicing problem-solving
- Understanding DSA fundamentals deeply
- Building reusable reference code
- Preparing for coding interviews and contests

---

## 🛠 Language

Most solutions are written in **Python**. 

---

## 📌 Usage

Feel free to:
- Browse the solutions
- Use them for practice or learning
- Suggest improvements or new problems
- Star ⭐ the repo if you find it useful
