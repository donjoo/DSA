🌳 What is a Heap?

A Heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.

There are two types:

    Max Heap: Parent node is always greater than or equal to its children

    Min Heap: Parent node is always less than or equal to its children

    ✅ Complete binary tree = All levels filled except possibly the last, filled left to right



🛠️ Heap Properties
Feature	                        Description
Shape Property	                Must be a complete binary tree
Heap Property	                Max Heap: parent ≥ children
Min Heap:                       parent ≤ children
Efficient Access	            Top element (max/min) is always at the root
